## Overview
This project aims to evaluate credit risk using machine learning techniques, focusing on identifying potential borrowers who may default on loans. By leveraging predictive modeling, this analysis provides critical insights to aid financial institutions in making informed decisions.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Handled missing values and outliers to improve dataset quality.
  - Scaled features using normalization techniques for optimal model performance.
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Implemented Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to predict credit risk.
  - Performed hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy.
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Assessed model performance using metrics like ROC-AUC, precision-recall, and F1-score.
  - Visualized results with confusion matrices and feature importance charts.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming**: Python
- **Libraries**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Insights
- Identified key predictors of credit risk, such as income, loan amount, and credit history.
- Improved model precision to reduce false positives and minimize financial risk.

## How to Use
- Clone the repository and follow the instructions in the `README.md`.
- Execute the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to reproduce the analysis.
